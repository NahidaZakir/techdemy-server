        "question": "How to Troubleshoot Audio & Video Issues (on a Browser)",
        "answer": "1. Try watching the original lecture in an incognito window. 2. If the video plays without issue, try checking your extension, plugin or firewall program on your device to see if it needs to be reconfigured or disabled.3. If you’re encountering the issue while watching the video on your company’s network, try watching the video on a non-company network instead. If you’re able to watch the video without any issue, please report the issue to your company’s IT team. 4. Try a different browser. If you’re not already using Google Chrome, we recommend using it, as we’ve found it works best to watch Udemy courses. 5. Clear your browser's cookies and cache and restart it before trying again. 6. If you have a lot of browser tabs open, close most of them except the one you’re using to watch the course. 7. Check your browser version and update it if needed. "
